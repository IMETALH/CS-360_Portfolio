CS 360 Weight Tracker Application is designed to meet school project requirements.  I chose to build the Weight Tracker App to help users develop good habits of keeping track of their weight loss progress. Users can set a target weight loss weight gain goal within the app. The best app icon that will best represent the Weight Tracker App in the app store is a human body on a scale image icon. The app is a typical event tracking app that allows users to record their weight based on date and weight value in pounds.

This Weight Tracker app has the ability to notify users when their weight loss weight gain goal has been met. Within the app, there is a log-in / create account page that allows users to create their personal accounts with a username and password. After creating an account, the app will directly take users to a “Daily Weights” page where the user can record their daily weights in a table. 

I started my development process by identifying application-specific functions that are directly related to the user’s needs. I viewed the user need(s) as a real solution function that covers the users' actual tasks, implementation requirements, users' roadblocks to performing these tasks, and the gains after the success of the user's tasks. Then I analyzed whether the user's needs are real or not because if the user's needs are not real, there will be a problem with the development process. I have learned to define and understand the user’s problem, then do extensive research to better assume the user’s problem and proceed to the design phase.

Functionality test was performed throughout the entire development process and android studio made this process a little easier by integrating a virtual device (android emulator) where a developing application can get functionality test while in development. 

The challenges that I had while developing this app were mainly on the application logic and the process of activating the app's buttons through the controller classes. I had the most success in the UI design process where I had to add buttons and popup windows.
