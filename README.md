# CS---360-Mobile-Architect-Programming-

The CS 360 Weight Tracker Application is designed to fulfill school project requirements. I developed this app to help users build the habit of tracking their weight loss progress. Users can set goals for weight loss or weight gain within the app. An ideal app icon for representing the Weight Tracker App in the app store would be an image of a human body on a scale. The app functions as a typical event tracking tool, allowing users to record their weight along with the date and weight value in pounds.

The app can notify users when they achieve their weight loss or weight gain goals. It includes a login/create account page where users can set up personal accounts with a username and password. After creating an account, users are taken directly to the 'Daily Weights' page, where they can record their daily weights in a table.

I began the development process by identifying application-specific functions that directly address user needs. I treated these needs as real solutions that cover users' tasks, implementation requirements, obstacles, and the benefits of successfully completing these tasks. Next, I assessed whether these needs were genuine, as unrealistic needs could hinder the development process. I learned to clearly define and understand the user's problem, conduct thorough research to accurately assess the issue, and then proceed to the design phase.

Functionality testing was conducted throughout the development process, with Android Studio facilitating this through its integration of a virtual device (Android emulator). This feature allowed for ongoing functionality tests of the application during its development.

The main challenges I encountered while developing this app were related to application logic and the process of activating the app's buttons through the controller classes. However, I found the most success in the UI design process, particularly with adding buttons and implementing popup windows.
